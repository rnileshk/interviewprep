          <h2>Course Overview</h2>
          <p>
            The Operating System (OS) course provides a comprehensive
            understanding of the core software that manages computer hardware
            and software resources. As a critical component in computer science,
            this subject forms the backbone of modern computing devices â€” from
            personal computers and smartphones to large-scale servers and
            embedded systems. Through this course, students will explore how an
            operating system functions as an intermediary between users and the
            computer hardware. Topics covered include process management, memory
            management, file systems, I/O handling, and system security. It also
            delves into CPU scheduling algorithms, synchronization techniques,
            and deadlock handling, which are essential for designing efficient
            and reliable systems. Students will gain practical insights into how
            popular operating systems like Windows, Linux, and Unix operate,
            including the design of real-time and distributed operating systems.
            By understanding system calls, kernel operations, and resource
            allocation, learners will be equipped to build or work with robust
            software systems in real-world applications.
